# Introduction

## What is OpenGL?

It is considered as an API which provides set of function to manipulate graphics and images. By itself, however, is merely a specification developed and maintained by [Khronos](www.khronos.org)

## Core Profile v.s. Immediate Mode

Immediate mode (or fixed-function pipeline) is easy to use but it did not have much control over how OpenGL does calculation. Hence, the OpenGL's core profile mode is flexible and efficient.
